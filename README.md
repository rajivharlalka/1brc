# 1BRC Challenge

This is my attempt to the ongoing [1BRC challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc). I chose Perl as my language in an attempt to learn concurrent and parallel programming in perl and also have some fun.

## Attempt - 1

This is a pure brute force with no optimizations.
**Timing**: Didn't terminate for 10+min, thus stopped.

## More attempts coming soon...

Thanks to [Gunnar Morling](https://github.com/gunnarmorling) for hosting this fun challenge.
